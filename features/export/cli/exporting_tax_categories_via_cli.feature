Feature: exporting tax categories to csv-file
    In order to have my tax categories exported to an external target
    As a Developer
    I want to be able to export tax categories data to csv file from the commandline

    Background:
        Given I have a working command-line interface
        And the store has a tax category "cloth"
        And this tax category name is "Cloth"
        And this tax category description is "Shirts and Jeans"

    @cli_importer_exporter
    Scenario: Exporting tax categories to csv-file
        When I export "tax_category" data as "csv" to the file "tax_categories_export.csv" with the cli-command
        Then I should see "Exported" in the output
        And I should see in the file:
            | Code  | Name  | Description      |
            | cloth | Cloth | Shirts and Jeans |
